Throughout this codebase I assume a right-handed coordinate system
where +X = right, +Y = down, and +Z = forward (into the screen).

Distance units are assumed to be 'meters' unless specified otherwise.
When dealing with raster data, the size of a pixel must be explicitly provided
(usually in terms of 'pixels per meter', which is what 'resolution' refers to)
to convert to physical distance units.
